# Chaikin's Algorithm Implementation in Rust + Macroquad

A step-by-step animated implementation of Chaikin's corner-cutting subdivision algorithm for creating smooth curves from control points.

## ðŸŽ¯ What is Chaikin's Algorithm?

Chaikin's algorithm is a corner-cutting subdivision technique that creates smooth curves from polygonal control points. It works by iteratively:

1. **Taking each edge** between consecutive points
2. **Creating two new points** at 25% and 75% positions along each edge  
3. **Replacing the original polygon** with these new points
4. **Repeating the process** to create increasingly smooth curves

After 7 iterations, sharp corners become beautifully smooth curves!
